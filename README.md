Hi, I am YiÄŸit, a Computer Engineering undergraduate in Bilkent.

I am interested in computer architecture and embedded systems,
as well as back-end development and text-image classification.

If you are looking for contribution to your project, reach me at
yigit.kucuk@ug.bilkent.edu.tr & yigitkucukbusiness@gmail.com

I mostly work with Java, C++, SystemVerilog and Python, but I can adapt.
